# Week 0: Introduction to Chip Modeling, Tool Setup & VLSI SoC Design Flow  

This week lays the foundation for **Digital VLSI System-on-Chip (SoC) design**, covering the complete workflow from high-level application modeling to silicon implementation.  
Participants will set up the required tools, verify their environment, and gain a strong understanding of the end-to-end design process.  
The goal is to ensure a **validated and reproducible setup** for all future design stages.

## Chip Modeling and Digital VLSI SoC Design Workflow  

### 1. C-Based Modeling (O1)  
- Model the application in **C** using GCC with `-O0` optimization.  
- Generate and compare outputs with `-O1` optimization for target processors (RISC, ARM).  
- **Goal:** Match `O0` and `O1` outputs → freeze as **specification baseline**.  

---

### 2. RTL Architecture (O2)  
- Translate the validated specification into **RTL (Verilog)**.  
- Develop a **gate-level representation** of the architecture.  
- Simulate the application on RTL.  
- **Goal:** Verify O2 RTL outputs match O1 C model outputs.  

---

### 3. RTL Processing & IP Integration (O3)  
- Partition RTL into **processor** and **peripheral IPs**:  
  - **Processor:** Synthesizable, gate-level CPU.  
  - **Peripheral IPs:**  
    - Digital macros (synth RTL).  
    - Analog functional RTL (e.g., ADCs, PLLs).  
- Integrate all blocks into a unified **SoC** (with GPIOs, etc.).  
- **Goal:** Confirm identical outputs across O1, O2, and O3 levels.

### 4. Physical Design & Tapeout (O4)  
- Perform **physical design**: floorplanning, placement, clock tree synthesis (CTS), and routing.  
- Generate and verify **GDSII** (DRC/LVS checks).  
- Upon validation, proceed with **tapeout**, fabrication, packaging, and testing.  
- Run the same application on silicon to confirm specification compliance.  
- **Target:** Processor frequency = **100–130 MHz**.

## ✅ Key Takeaway  
This structured workflow (O1 → O4), combined with robust **toolchain setup** and **environment verification**, guarantees the **functional correctness, design integrity, and reproducibility** of both the application and hardware design, as referenced in *Getting Started with Digital VLSI SoC Design and Planning*.
